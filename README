EVE

Eve is a multi purpose, web based agent platform. The project aims to develop 
an open protocol for communication between software agents. Eve is designed as 
a decentral, scalable system for autonomously acting agents. Eve uses the 
existing world wide web as platform, and uses existing protocols for data 
exchange (HTTP) and for messaging (JSON-RPC).
