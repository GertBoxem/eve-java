TODO

- store a default availability profile (-> in the PersonalAgent?)
- the meetingagent must automatically start autoUpdate
- change subscribe and unsubscribe to onSubscribe and onUnsubscribe

EXTRA

MeetingAgent:
  - automatically start auto updating
  - handle whole-day events
  - handle event status (for example set to declined when a user deleted the 
    event from its calendar)
  - be able to manipulate attendees in your google calendar 
  - start negotiating with other agents for a timeslot
  - schedule over different locations
  - schedule a (minimum?) number of people from a group
  - schedule optional people
  - in case of not satisfiable constraints, give feedback on which of the 
    constraints can be changed best (exclude some people, plan later, make 
    event shorter, find an other location, etc)
