EVE release management (tips & tricks & procedures)

Terminology: Eve is layed out according to the "Flat" project model, with a separate parent project folder at the same level as the modules,
compared to the "standard" model in which the parent pom resides in the top-level folder.

Most Maven commands are run in the parent project pom folder.

- #mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<version_no>[-SNAPSHOT]

- if multi-artifact project fails to build due to children depend on a non-installed parent, you might have to first only install the parent:
  #mvn clean install -N    //(-N signifies: Non-recursive)

- Currently on every build, the following steps are taken:
	-Build sources
	-Copy resources and classes to target
	-package jar/war
	-package sources into -sources.jar
	-Generate javaDocs
	-package javadocs into -javadoc jar
	-PGP sign all packages and the pom files

- When running #mvn deploy:  -SNAPSHOTS are deployed to oss.sonatype.com/
			     -Non-snapshot versions (releases) are deployed to the staging repository of sonatype.

-To get rid of lifecycle-mapping warnings in maven:
	#create and get into a temp folder
	#mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.eclipse.m2e -DartifactId=lifecycle-mapping -Dversion=1.0.0 -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-mojo
	#cd lifecycle-mapping
	#mvn install

Description of release process:

Requirements:
-Sonatype JIRA account (connected to com.almende, through a separate ticket, ask me:)
-A GPG-key that has been published. ($ gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys <KEYNUM>)

1: have a <ver>-SNAPSHOT working copy ready, in parent folder

2: mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<ver>
3: git commit -a
4: git push --all

5: git tag <ver>  //(version with prefix 'v', e.g. v1.1.0)
6: git push --tags
7: mvn clean deploy -Prelease

8: mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<ver+1>-SNAPSHOT
9: git commit -a
10: git push --all
